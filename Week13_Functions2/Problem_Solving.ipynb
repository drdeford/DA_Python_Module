    "This week we are going to continue our work with functions and develop our problem-solving skills. One of the great uses of functions is that they allow us to decompose a large complicated problem into a collection of smaller subroutines that we can accomplish individually. A natural way to experiment with these ideas is to construct games that allow you to interact with the computer. \n",
