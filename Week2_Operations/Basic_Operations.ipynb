    "Python provides support for many common arithmetic operations like addition and multiplication. When run in a Jupyter cell, the output of the calculation is displayed below the cell. The computations follow the normal order of operations from algebra and parentheses can be used to group sub-calculations. Try changing some of the values and operations in the cells below and re-running them to get some practice. Don't worry if you make a mistake - errors are very common in programming, and learning to recover from them is an important part of this course. "

For now, it is probably helpful to think of a variable as just giving a new name to an object, that we can use to refer to it later on. In Python, it is very easy to create new variables (equivalently, given new names to values) with the equals sign. We put the name of the variable on the left hand side of the equals sign and the value we want to store in that variable on the right hand side. In Jupyter notebooks, variables persist between cells once they've been evaluated. Try changing the value of `a` in the cell below and then run the next cell to see that the value has changed. \n"

Similarly, python doesn't know how to combine a string and an integer with the `+` sign (although the last example shows that it views multiplication by an integer as repeated self-concatenation. What happens if you change 3 to 3.1?). The error text is supposed to be helpful in determining what went wrong but nothing is perfect.
